# Detection with pytorch mobile
*Probably first open-source mobile detection on pytorch*

## Description
Most of the [detection ops](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/ops.html) not implemented in pytorch mobile. 
But it's possible to implement post-processing ops, like nms, and apply them.

## Why it's low accuracy?
I'm not sure. I noticed that model has slightly different outputs on Android and Python.  
I think, it might be quantization issue (doubleâ†’float) or differences of implementations.
